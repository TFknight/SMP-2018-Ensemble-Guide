## Task description
Given an article, we need to create algorithms that judge types of authors (automatic summary, machine translation, robot writer or human writer). 
More details see [SMP EUPT 2018](https://www.biendata.com/competition/smpeupt2018/)

## 1.Requirements
* lightgbm
* gensim
* scikit-learn
* pickle
* numpy

## 2.Models
We have improved the traditional [Stacking](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/26890738 "悬停显示") method, concating the probability vectors generated by each classifier, and reclassifying them with Lightgbm.

    $ python3 smp_sta_all_vec.py
Performing the Blending method on the stitched probability vector.

    $ python3 smp_lgb_blending.py
